<!-- TODO some sort of foreword; why we are making this -->

Land use information is needed to respond to New Zealand's environmental, social and economic challenges, including water quality, soil erosion, natural disaster planning and response, and greenfield development.

# The New Zealand Standard Land Use Classification Framework

The NZSLUC Framework presents principles, procedures and definitions for designing compliant land use classification systems. 

<!-- Informative -->
## Principles

1. To support the production of **nationally consistent** data on land use
2. To suppot classification systems that classify land at the **parcel level or beyond**. <!-- More explicit scale? Raster/DGGS resolution? Landscape objects? -->
3. To facilitate the production of **consistent land use information** in New Zealand, such as from regional government agencies.
4. To facilitate the use of land use data at national, regional and local scales.
5. To incorporate land management practices when needed to distinguish between land uses.
6. To **propose** NZSLUC classifications that are intended to be revised in a series of reviews with partners and stakeholders
    - It is particularly important that **iwi/MƒÅori partners** are involved throughout.
<!-- - To achieve national understanding before releasing the data adhering to a proposed classification system. -->
7. To support the development and implementation of **more than one classification system** under this framework _and_ to ensure that they are broadly compatible. <!-- Compatible = weasly? -->
8. To balance **reliability, practicality, and cost effectiveness** in the production of land use data artefacts.
9. To adhere to specifications for land use classfications including:
    - To attribute of the prime land use
    - To facilitate attribution of secondary or mixed uses
    - To record source information (i.e. provenance: geographic scale, date, and confidence)
    - To be able to record commodities from a set of standard codes (e.g. DataLinker, Stats NZ)
    - To be able to record management practices from a set of standard codes (to be determined)
    <!-- - Tenure -->
10. To aspire to ensure overall attribute accuracy of greater than 80 per cent.
11. To carefully develop these principles, proceedures, definitions and classification systems themselves over time, with concern for backwards compatibility.
12. To require allowing multiple land uses to be represented
13. To require allowing land use classification systems to be multidimensional (ref. Rutledge) <!-- Semantic? -->
<!-- - To allow the incorportation of multiple dimensions of land use -->
<!-- - To require that participating land use classifications are multidimensional in operation -->
<!-- - Dimensions
    - Commodities
    - Management practices
    - Tenure -->

<!-- Principles for reuse -->
<!-- Principles for contribution -->
<!-- Principles for systematic classification -->
<!-- Principles for publishing data artefacts -->

## Procedures 

<!-- Mutlidimensional? What dimensions? -->
<!-- Proceedure for reporting land use change? -->
<!-- Independent validation and quality assurance? -->
- Recommended that published data is independently validated, and quality is described using a standard such as xyz
- One or more established metadata standards shall be used when publishing data
<!-- LUML? -->
<!-- Compatibility with other classification systems in components, e.g. PAN-NZ, ANZLIC for industrial categories, Dairy NZ classes, etc.? -->
<!-- What is the extent? Marine? What is "land"? EEZ, etc. -->

## Definitions / Key Concepts
