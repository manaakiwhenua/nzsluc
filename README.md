<!-- TODO some sort of foreword; why we are making this -->

Land use information is needed to respond to New Zealand's environmental, social and economic challenges, including water quality, soil erosion, natural disaster planning and response, and greenfield development.

# The New Zealand Standard Land Use Classification Framework

The NZSLUC Framework presents principles, procedures and definitions for designing compliant land use classification systems. 

<!-- Informative -->
## Principles

- To support the production of **nationally consistent** model for classifying land use based on common characteristics supported by data
- To suppot classification systems that classify land at the **parcel level or beyond**. <!-- More explicit scale? Raster/DGGS resolution? Landscape objects? -->
- To facilitate the production of **consistent land use information** in New Zealand, such as from regional government agencies.
- To facilitate the use of land use data at national, regional and local scales.
- To incorporate land management practices when needed to distinguish between land uses.
- To **propose** NZSLUC classifications that are intended to be revised in a series of reviews with partners and stakeholders
    - It is particularly important that **iwi/MƒÅori partners** are involved throughout.
<!-- - To achieve national understanding before releasing the data adhering to a proposed classification system. -->
- To support the development and implementation of **more than one classification system** under this framework _and_ to ensure that they are broadly compatible. <!-- Compatible = weasly? -->
- To balance **reliability, practicality, and cost effectiveness** in the production of land use data artefacts.
- To adhere to specifications for land use classfications including:
    - To attribute of the prime land use
    - To facilitate attribution of secondary or mixed uses
    - To record source information (i.e. provenance: geographic scale, date, and confidence)
    - To be able to record commodities from a set of standard codes (e.g. DataLinker, Stats NZ)
    - To be able to record management practices from a set of standard codes (to be determined)
    <!-- - Tenure -->
- To aspire to ensure overall attribute accuracy of greater than 80 per cent.
- To carefully develop these principles, proceedures, definitions and classification systems themselves over time, with concern for backwards compatibility.
- To require allowing multiple land uses to be represented
- To require allowing land use classification systems to be multidimensional (ref. Rutledge) <!-- Semantic? -->
<!-- - To allow the incorportation of multiple dimensions of land use -->
<!-- - To require that participating land use classifications are multidimensional in operation -->
<!-- - Dimensions
    - Commodities
    - Management practices
    - Tenure -->

<!-- Principles for reuse -->
<!-- Principles for contribution -->
<!-- Principles for systematic classification -->
<!-- Principles for publishing data artefacts -->

## Procedures 

<!-- Mutlidimensional? What dimensions? -->
<!-- Proceedure for reporting land use change? -->
<!-- Independent validation and quality assurance? -->
- Recommended that published data is independently validated, and quality is described using a standard such as xyz
- One or more established metadata standards shall be used when publishing data
<!-- LUML? -->
<!-- Compatibility with other classification systems in components, e.g. PAN-NZ, ANZLIC for industrial categories, Dairy NZ classes, etc.? -->
<!-- What is the extent? Marine? What is "land"? EEZ, etc. -->

## Definitions / Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Reference(s) |

| Land use | The purpose to which land is committed. | ... |
| Tenure | The form of an interest in land. | ... |
| Commodity | A product. | ... |
| Management practice | A practice. | ... |
