## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue. 

1.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by an issues.
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

2.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).



## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub,
you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
In brief:

We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes: <br>
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.<br>
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.<br>
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.<br>
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].<br>
    5.  If you receive feedback,
        make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub:
        the pull request will update automatically.
