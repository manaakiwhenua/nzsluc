# LBCS Activity Dimension with Detail Descriptions
Activity is one of five dimensions in land-based classifications. Each dimension is an attribute that takes
the appropriate four-digit code. Only by using all five dimensions can one fully represent all land uses
and describe their characteristics. See the other dimensions before applying LBCS.

## Activity
#### An observable characteristic of land based on actual use.
Activity refers to the actual use of land based on its observable characteristics. It describes what
actually takes place in physical or observable terms (e.g., farming, shopping, manufacturing, vehicular
movement, etc.). An office activity, for example, refers only to the physical activity on the premises,
which could apply equally to a law firm, a nonprofit institution, a court house, a corporate office, or any
other office use. Similarly, residential uses in single-family dwellings, multifamily structures,
manufactured houses, or any other type of building, would all be classified as residential activity.

## Function
#### The economic use or type of establishment using the land.
Function refers to the economic function or type of establishment using the land. Every land-use can
be characterized by the type of establishment it serves. Land-use terms, such as agricultural,
commercial, industrial, relate to establishments. The type of economic function served by the land-use
gets classified in this dimension; it is independent of actual activity on the land. Establishments can
have a variety of activities on their premises, yet serve a single function. For example, two parcels are
said to be in the same functional category if they serve the same establishment, even if one is an office
building and the other is a factory.

## Structure
#### Type of structure or building type on the land.
Structure refers to the type of structure or building on the land. Land-use terms embody a structural or
building characteristic, which indicates the utility of the space (in a building) or land (when there is no
building). Land-use terms, such as single-family house, office building, warehouse, hospital building, or
highway, also describe structural characteristic. Although many activities and functions are closely
associated with certain structures, it is not always so. Many buildings are often adapted for uses other
than its original use. For instance, a single-family residential structure may be used as an office.

## Site
#### The overall physical site development character of the land.
Site development character refers to the overall physical development character of the land. It describes
"what is on the land" in general physical terms. For most land uses, it is simply expressed in terms of
whether the site is developed or not. But not all sites without observable development can be treated as
undeveloped. Land uses, such as parks and open spaces, which often have a complex mix of activities,
functions, and structures on them, need categories independent of other dimensions. This dimension
uses categories that describe the overall site development characteristics.

## Ownership
#### Legal and quasi-legal ownership constraints of the land.
Ownership refers to the relationship between the use and its land rights. Since the function of most
land uses is either public or private and not both, distinguising ownership characteristics seems
obvious. However, relying solely on the functional character may obscure such uses as private parks,
public theaters, private stadiums, private prisons, and mixed public and private ownership. Moreover,
easements and similar legal devices also limit or constrain land-use activities and functions. This
dimension allows classifying such ownership characteristics more accurately.
