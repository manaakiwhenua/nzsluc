‘Land use’, ‘land cover’ and ‘land management’ are often used interchangeably in discussions about land use. This erroneous use seems to largely stem from a lack of awareness of the distinct meaning of each of these terms.  The following definitions, which have been drawn from the [Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.awe.gov.au/abares/aclump/definitions), help to make explicit the differences. 
- Land cover refers to the physical surface of the earth. This may include vegetation types, naturally bare surfaces (e.g., exposed rock, permanent snow and ice, etc.), and water bodies. This may also include anthropogenic elements, such as transport infrastructure, built environments or agriculture. Land cover can usually be determined by observable patterns via remote sensing, aerial imagery, etc. 
- Land use means the purpose to which the land is committed. This may include:
    1. the production of goods---e.g. crops (agronomy?), timber, manufacturing...
    1. services---e.g. defence, recreation, biodiversity, natural resources protection...
    1. place of spiritual connection
    1. sacred
- Land management practice refers to the approach taken to achieve a land use---e.g. cultivation practices, stocking rate density, etc.). 
- Land use classification may provide general information on land cover, and the types of human activity involved in land management.
