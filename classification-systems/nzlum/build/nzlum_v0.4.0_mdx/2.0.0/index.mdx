Land used principally for primary production, where native vegetation has largely been replaced by introduced species through clearing, the sowing of new species, the application of fertilisers, or the dominance of volunteer species. Includes plantation forests, pasture production for stock, cropping and fodder production, and horticultural production.

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  If there is evidence of irrigation infrastructure or water-take consents, record irrigation as a management practice, even if irrigation water has not been recently applied.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Usage note" icon="puzzle">
  Fallow or ploughed land should be assigned to the most likely land use based on the dominant activity conducted in comparable nearby areas or other available evidence. Fallow or ploughed land should be allocated to the relevant pasture, cropping or horticultural class (rather than using land in transition). The fallow or ploughed status should be recorded in the management field.
</Aside>

## 2.1.0 Plantation forests

## 2.2.0 Grazing modified pasture systems

Grazing pasture and/or forage systems based on significant active modification or replacement of the natural vegetation.

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Land under pasture at the time of mapping may be in a rotation system, so that at another time the same area may be, for example, under cropping.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Dairy support is land that is used to support non-lactating dairy stock (dry cows, heifers and calves). It will include any feed required, and will often include winter crops and potentially summer crops (location/irrigation dependent), along with cereal crops, such as maize, barley, and wheat. It can also include feed that is cut and carried to the milking platform. Dairy support land that is not actively used for grazing should be classified as an arable use.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Usage note" icon="puzzle">
  The ability to distinguish between dairy and dry-stock production is provided by including the relevant commodity information, such as `cattle dairy`, `cattle beef`, `sheep wool`, `sheep meat`, etc. Multiple commodities should be recorded if appropriate. Crops used in rotation should also be recorded as commodities, if known.
</Aside>

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.2.1 Dairy">
    Land on which milking cows (or other stock, such as goats or sheep) are grazed during the milking season, where dairy is the primary purpose of the land.
<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Dairy production systems can include rotations of grazed forage crops and maize for silage, and dry-stock grazing, but this class should only be used where dairy is the primary purpose of the land.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Where the land is permanently used for dry-stock grazing, it should be classified under dry-stock land use.
</Aside>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.2.2 Intensive dry stock">
    Non-milking platform grazing land with higher inputs (e.g. fertiliser), higher likelihood of irrigation, and higher stocking rates; typically on flat or rolling terrain.
<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Land used for high-intensity dry-stock grazing may include rotations for arable or winter forage crops, as well as grazing of non-lactating (dry) dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and cattle breeding.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Usage note" icon="puzzle">
  Stock density is an ideal attribute to assist in classification of intensive vs extensive dry stock; physiography (i.e. flat/hill/high country) can be used as a proxy where stock density data is absent.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Change note" icon="warning">
  A prior definition of this classes treated deer, goats, and horses as extensive by definition; it is now recogised that such systems can also be intensive.

</Aside>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.2.3 Extensive dry stock">
    Grazing on modified pastures with relatively fewer inputs, lower likelihood of irrigation, and lower stocking rates; more likely on hill, hard-hill, or high-country terrain.
<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Grazing livestock other than dairy, sheep or beef should usually be captured in this class (though it does not exclude sheep or beef)
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Where there is a high proportion of indigenous vegetation for grazing land, land use should be classified as grazing native vegetation.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Scope note" icon="information">
  Arable or winter forage crops are unlikely to be common rotations in this land-use category

</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Usage note" icon="puzzle">
  If the type of crop is known, record this in the commodity field. For mixed arable and livestock operations, both commodities should be captured as the primary commodity (neither is ancillary).
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Change note" icon="warning">
  The explicit five year periodicity was added in v0.4.0.
