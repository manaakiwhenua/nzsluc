- **1.0.0 Conservation and Minimal Use**
  Class 1.0.0 includes land that has a relatively low level of human intervention. The land may be formally reserved by government for conservation purposes, or conserved through other legal or administrative arrangements. Areas may have multiple uses but nature conservation is a central consideration. (Some land may be unused because of a deliberate decision of the government or landowner, or due to circumstances).
  > [!NOTE]
  > Areas with lower levels of biodiversity protection are anticipated to have other primary uses, but biodiversity protection ranking could be captured as an ancillary use with class 1.1.4 and 1.1.5.
  
  > [!TIP]
  > Where a classification is based on information about legal protection, the relevant information (e.g. the Act) should be mentioned in the `comment` field.

  - **1.1.0 Nature conservation**
    Nature conservation classes are determined by the classification scheme adopted for the Protected Areas Network of New Zealand (PAN-NZ).

    - **1.1.1 Strict nature reserve**
      Protected area managed mainly for science. An area of land possessing outstanding or representative ecosystems, geological or physiological features or species, which is available primarily for scientific research and/or environmental monitoring.

    - **1.1.2 Wilderness area**
      Protected area managed mainly for wilderness protection. A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition.

    - **1.1.3 National Park**
      Protected area managed mainly for ecosystem conservation and recreation. A natural area of land, designated to:

  a) protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for the current and future generations;

  b) exclude exploitation or occupation detrimental to the purposes of designation of the area; and

  c) provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities, all of which must be environmentally and culturally compatible.

    - **1.1.4 Natural feature protection**
      Protected area managed for conservation of specific natural features. An area containing one or more specific natural or cultural features that are of outstanding value because of their inherent rarity, representative or aesthetic qualities, or cultural significance.

    - **1.1.5 Habitat or species management area**
      Protected area managed mainly for conservation through management intervention. An area of land or sea subject to active intervention for management purposes to ensure the maintenance of habitats or to meet the requirements of specific species. This may include areas on private land.

    - **1.1.6 Protected landscape**
      Protected area managed mainly for landscape conservation and recreation. An area of land where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced a distinct character with significant aesthetic, cultural or ecological value, and often high biodiversity.

    - **1.1.7 Other conserved area**
      Land under forms of nature conservation protection that fall outside the scope of the CAPAD classification. This includes heritage agreements, voluntary conservation arrangements, registered property agreements, and recreation areas with primarily native cover .
      > [!NOTE]
      > If the recreation area is primarily cleared or non-native cover assign to 3.2.1 ‘Outdoor recreation’

  - **1.2.0 Cultural and natural heritage**
    Conservation classes are for purposes other than biodiversity protecton.

    - **1.2.1 Indigenous cultural heritage**
      Indigenous cultural heritage sites and areas (e.g. historical pā sites, New Zealand land wars sites, and other indigenous heritage sites).

    - **1.2.2 Cultural heritage**
      Cultural heritage areas (e.g. historical mining sites, selected DOC 'iconic sites', Toru Whenua and other cultural landmarks).

    - **1.2.3 Natural heritage**
      Protected areas for the conservation of specific natural features and landscapes (e.g. UNESCO Global Geoparks).

  - **1.3.0 Minimal use from relatively natural environments**
    This class includes land that is subject to relatively low levels of intervention or that is largely unused in the context of prime use or use for resource protection. This land may be covered with indigenous or exotic plant species. It includes land where the structure of the native vegetation generally remains intact despite deliberate use, although the floristics of the vegetation may have changed markedly (e.g. grazing on native tussock land).
    > [!NOTE]
    > Where native grasses have been deliberately and extensively replaced with other species, the land use should not be classified under class 1.

    - **1.3.1 Surface water supply**
      An area managed as a catchment for water supply.

    - **1.3.2 Ground water**
      An area managed as an aquifer recharge zone.

    - **1.3.3 Grazing native vegetation**
      Land uses based on grazing by domestic stock on native vegetation where there has been limited or no deliberate attempt at pasture modification (e.g. native tussock grazing). Some change in species composition may have occurred.
      > [!TIP]
      > This is probably limited to South Island high-country farms. Verification (e.g. assessment of vegetation on grazed land) to assess the extent of modification is required. ALUM specifies this class when there is greater than 50% dominant native species, although this criterion needs to be confirmed as being appropriate in a New Zealand context.

    - **1.3.4 Production from indigenous vegetation**
      Commercial production from retained (non-plantation) native forests and related activities on public and private land (e.g. selective native timber production without clearfelling, and other non-sawlong, non-pulpwood, native forest products including oil, wildflowers, firewood, fenceposts, and mānuka/kānuka honey).

    - **1.3.5 Customary use**
      Natural environments associated with traditional and sustainable Indigenous food-gathering practices (mahinga kai).
      > [!NOTE]
      > This may include land zoned for Māori purposes, and should only describe contemporary, not historical, use.
      
      > [!TIP]
      > This is often an ancillary use; assign only if customary use is the prime use of the land.

    - **1.3.6 Defence land**
      Natural areas allocated to field training, weapons testing, and other field defence uses, predominantly in rural areas.
      > [!NOTE]
      > Areas associated with buildings or more built environments on defence land are captured under an urban class.
      
      > [!TIP]
      > **Example**

      > [!NOTE]
      > This is not limited to indigenous vegetation.
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > Land planted for environmental and infrastructure protection should be captured under 2.1.4.

    - **1.3.8 Carbon forest**
      Retained (non-planted) indigenous vegetation set aside for carbon credits.

  - **1.4.0 Unused land and land in transition**
    Corridors and roadside areas may fit under this class, along with unused land (in the sense of productive, conservation or urban use), such as cliffs, rock faces, boulders, and tors, where there are relatively low levels of disturbance. It does not include land undergoing natural succession in the context of changing plant species.
    > [!TIP]
    > Delineation between indigenous and exotic vegetation for the minimal use and unused land and land in transition classes can be made by reference to land-cover information.

    - **1.4.1 Unused land**
      Land that is unusable for productive agriculture or urban uses, such as cliffs, rock faces, boulders, and tors, where there are relatively low levels of disturbance.

    - **1.4.2 Land undergoing rehabilitation**
      Degraded land (e.g. due to erosion or flood damage) that is being actively rehabilitated through planting with indigenous or exotic species to return land to a natural state (including riparian plantings).

- **2.0.0 Production agriculture and plantations**
  Land used principally for primary production, where native vegetation has largely been replaced by introduced species through clearing, the sowing of new species, the application of fertilisers, or the dominance of volunteer species. Includes plantation forests, pasture production for stock, cropping and fodder production, and horticultural production.
  > [!NOTE]
  > If there is evidence of irrigation infrastructure or water-take consents, record irrigation as a management practice, even if irrigation water has not been recently applied.
  
  > [!TIP]
  > Fallow or ploughed land should be assigned to the most likely land use based on the dominant activity conducted in comparable nearby areas or other available evidence. Fallow or ploughed land should be allocated to the relevant pasture, cropping or horticultural class (rather than using land in transition). The fallow or ploughed status should be recorded in the management field.

  - **2.1.0 Plantation forests**
    Land on which plantations of trees or shrubs (native or exotic species) have been established (i.e. planted) for production, or environmental and resource protection purposes, including carbon forestry.

  - **2.2.0 Grazing modified pasture systems**
    Grazing pasture and/or forage systems based on significant active modification or replacement of the natural vegetation.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Land under pasture at the time of mapping may be in a rotation system, so that at another time the same area may be, for example, under cropping.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Dairy support is land that is used to support non-lactating dairy stock (dry cows, heifers and calves). It will include any feed required, and will often include winter crops and potentially summer crops (location/irrigation dependent), along with cereal crops, such as maize, barley, and wheat. It can also include feed that is cut and carried to the milking platform. Dairy support land that is not actively used for grazing should be classified as an arable use.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > The ability to distinguish between dairy and dry-stock production is provided by including the relevant commodity information, such as `cattle dairy`, `cattle beef`, `sheep wool`, `sheep meat`, etc. Multiple commodities should be recorded if appropriate. Crops used in rotation should also be recorded as commodities, if known.

    - **2.2.1 Dairy**
      Land on which milking cows (or other stock, such as goats or sheep) are grazed during the milking season, where dairy is the primary purpose of the land.
      > [!NOTE]
      > Dairy production systems can include rotations of grazed forage crops and maize for silage, and dry-stock grazing, but this class should only be used where dairy is the primary purpose of the land.
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > Where the land is permanently used for dry-stock grazing, it should be classified under dry-stock land use.

    - **2.2.2 Intensive dry stock**
      Non-milking platform grazing land with higher inputs (e.g. fertiliser), higher likelihood of irrigation, and higher stocking rates; typically on flat or rolling terrain.
      > [!NOTE]
      > Land used for high-intensity dry-stock grazing may include rotations for arable or winter forage crops, as well as grazing of non-lactating (dry) dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and cattle breeding. Grazing of other stock, including deer, goats, and horses, should be captured under class ‘2.2.3 Extensive dry stock’

    - **2.2.3 Extensive dry stock**
      Grazing on modified pastures with relatively fewer inputs, lower likelihood of irrigation, and lower stocking rates; more likely on hill, hard-hill, or high-country terrain.
      > [!NOTE]
      > Grazing livestock other than dairy, sheep or beef should usually be captured in this class (though it does not exclude sheep or beef)
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > Where there is a high proportion of indigenous vegetation for grazing land, land use should be classified as grazing native vegetation.
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > Arable or winter forage crops are unlikely to be common rotations in this land-use category
      
      > [!TIP]
      > The specific commodity or commodities should be noted if known.

  - **2.3.0 Short-rotation and seasonal cropping**
    This class includes agricultural practices characterised by the cultivation of crops with rapid turnover cycles and seasonal planting patterns, typically optimised for efficient land use and high-yield production.
    > [!NOTE]
    > This class encompasses agricultural activities such as the cultivation of fast-growing crops such as maize, barley, and certain vegetables, often rotated on short-term cycles to maintain soil health and maximise productivity.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Arable, and mixed livestock cropping, integrating both crop cultivation and animal husbandry, are also included in this class.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If the type of crop is known, record this in the commodity field. For mixed arable and livestock operations, both commodities should be captured as the primary commodity (neither is ancillary).

    - **2.3.1 Arable cropping**
      Predominantly grain, seed, or fodder crops (and over time may include vegetable rotations). May be used for dairy support.
      > [!TIP]
      > The specific commodity or commodities should be noted if known.

    - **2.3.2 Arable and mixed livestock cropping**
